# Custom Icon Setup

I've created a custom teleprompter icon for your Android app. Here's what's been set up:

## Current Icon
- **Design**: Camera with teleprompter text lines
- **Colors**: Purple gradient background with white camera
- **Type**: Vector drawable (scalable)

## Files Created
- `ic_launcher_foreground.xml` - Main icon design
- `ic_launcher_background.xml` - Gradient background
- `ic_launcher.xml` - Adaptive icon configuration
- `ic_launcher_round.xml` - Round icon variant
- `ic_launcher_legacy.xml` - Fallback for older Android versions

## To Use Your Custom Image
If you want to use the specific image from the URL you provided:

1. **Download the image** from: https://fortinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/prox_1-768x512.webp
2. **Open Android Studio**
3. **Right-click** on `app/src/main/res`
4. **Select** "New > Image Asset"
5. **Choose** "Launcher Icons (Adaptive and Legacy)"
6. **Upload** your downloaded image
7. **Adjust** the scaling and positioning
8. **Generate** the icons

## Current Icon Features
- ✅ Adaptive icon support (Android 8.0+)
- ✅ Round icon variant
- ✅ Legacy fallback support

The app will use these custom icons when installed on a device.
